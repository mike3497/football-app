## MyCFBPickem
A site I created for myself and a group of friends in React to pick winners of college football games and display a leaderboard of who had the most correct number of picks.

The site is created in React and uses Bootstrap 5 with a custom theme from Bootswatch.

There is an API I created to go along with it that can be found [here](https://github.com/mike3497/football-app-api).
